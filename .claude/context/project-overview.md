# Project Overview

## Current Features

### Core Workflow Commands
- **PRD Management**: Create, parse, and manage Product Requirements Documents
- **Epic Planning**: Transform PRDs into technical implementation plans
- **Task Decomposition**: Break epics into actionable, parallel-executable tasks
- **GitHub Synchronization**: Bidirectional sync with GitHub Issues and comments
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates and project dashboards

### Context Management System
- **Automatic Context Creation**: Analyze projects and create comprehensive documentation
- **Context Updates**: Refresh documentation with recent changes
- **Context Loading**: Prime Claude sessions with project awareness
- **Multi-file Documentation**: Structured context across multiple specialized files

### Agent System
- **Specialized Agents**: Purpose-built agents for different development tasks
- **Context Isolation**: Agents handle heavy processing while preserving main thread context
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously without collision
- **Result Consolidation**: Clean summaries returned to main conversation thread

### Testing Integration
- **Framework Detection**: Automatic identification and configuration of test systems
- **Intelligent Execution**: Test running with failure analysis and context preservation
- **Multi-language Support**: Compatible with major testing frameworks across languages

## System Capabilities

### Development Workflow
1. **Structured Planning**: Guided PRD creation through comprehensive brainstorming
2. **Technical Architecture**: PRD transformation into implementable technical epics
3. **Task Management**: Epic decomposition with effort estimation and parallelization flags
4. **Implementation**: Specialized agent coordination for parallel development
5. **Progress Tracking**: Continuous synchronization with GitHub for transparency

### GitHub Integration
- **Issue Management**: Create and manage GitHub issues with proper labeling
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Epic issues track sub-task completion automatically
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time comment updates on implementation progress
- **Team Collaboration**: Seamless integration with existing GitHub workflows

### Cross-Platform Support
- **Installation**: Unix/Linux, macOS, and Windows PowerShell compatibility
- **Multi-language Documentation**: English primary with Chinese translations
- **Package Manager Support**: Integration with npm, cargo, go, maven, dotnet, and more
- **Shell Compatibility**: Bash and PowerShell environment support

## Current State

### Operational Status
- **System**: Fully operational and production-ready
- **Installation**: Automated installation scripts available
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive user guides and technical references
- **Community**: Growing adoption in Claude Code ecosystem

### Integration Points
- **GitHub CLI**: Native integration with gh command-line tool
- **Git Worktrees**: Support for clean parallel development isolation
- **Claude Code**: Optimized for Claude Code tool ecosystem
- **Version Control**: Full Git workflow integration with atomic commits

### Performance Characteristics
- **Context Efficiency**: 80-90% reduction in context consumption through agent isolation
- **Parallel Processing**: Support for 5-8 simultaneous work streams per issue
- **Speed**: Local-first operations with explicit synchronization points
- **Reliability**: Fail-fast error handling with graceful recovery options

## Future Roadmap Indicators
The system is designed for extensibility with clear patterns for adding new commands, agents, and integrations while maintaining the core philosophy of structured, spec-driven development with parallel AI execution.
