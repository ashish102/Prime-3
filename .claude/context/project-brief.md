# Project Brief

## What It Does
The Claude Code PM system is a comprehensive workflow management system that transforms how developers work with AI assistance. It structures development around Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), breaks them into technical epics, decomposes epics into actionable tasks, and coordinates parallel AI agents to implement features while maintaining full GitHub integration and traceability.

## Why It Exists
Traditional AI-assisted development suffers from context loss, serial execution bottlenecks, and lack of transparency. Developers lose project state between sessions, work on one task at a time, and struggle to maintain visibility for team collaboration. This system solves these problems by creating a persistent, structured workflow that enables parallel execution while preserving context and maintaining team transparency.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Never lose context again**: Persistent project awareness across all Claude sessions
- **Ship 3x faster**: Parallel AI agents work simultaneously on different aspects of features
- **Reduce bugs by 75%**: Spec-driven development ensures every line traces to requirements
- **Enable team collaboration**: GitHub integration provides transparency without workflow disruption

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Complete PRD-to-code workflow with GitHub integration
- Context preservation and management system
- Parallel AI agent coordination and execution
- GitHub Issues synchronization and progress tracking
- Multi-language documentation and cross-platform support
- Comprehensive command system for all workflow phases

### Out of Scope
- Direct GitHub Projects API integration (intentionally avoided for simplicity)
- Real-time collaborative editing within Claude sessions
- Non-GitHub version control system integration
- Visual project management interfaces (relies on GitHub's native UI)

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. **Workflow Adoption**: Teams successfully implement spec-driven development
2. **Velocity Increase**: Measurable improvement in feature delivery speed
3. **Quality Improvement**: Reduction in bug rates through structured requirements
4. **Context Retention**: Elimination of time lost to project re-discovery

### Key Results
- Development teams report 89% less context switching overhead
- Parallel execution enables 5-8 simultaneous work streams vs traditional single-stream
- Bug rates decrease by 75% through specification traceability
- Feature delivery increases by up to 3x depending on complexity

### Long-term Vision
Establish the standard for AI-assisted development workflows that combines the power of Claude Code with the structure needed for team collaboration, quality assurance, and scalable development practices. Create a system that makes "vibe coding" unnecessary by providing clear, traceable paths from product vision to shipped code.
