# Task: Core Number Theory Module Implementation

## Description
Implement the core mathematical algorithms in `prime/nt.py` including deterministic Miller-Rabin primality testing for 64-bit integers, hybrid factorization using trial division and Pollard's Rho, and arithmetic progression analysis with early termination.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `is_prime_64()` function with deterministic Miller-Rabin using 12 known bases (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37)
- [ ] `is_probable_prime()` function with probabilistic fallback for edge cases
- [ ] `factorize()` function using trial division for small primes, then Pollard's Rho + Brent for large composites
- [ ] `prime_run_length()` function for arithmetic progression analysis with early termination
- [ ] Input validation and 64-bit range detection with graceful handling
- [ ] Comprehensive docstrings with algorithm citations and complexity analysis

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Pure Python for educational value and control
- **Algorithm sources**: Cite Miller-Rabin base sets in code comments
- **Performance**: Handle up to 64-bit unsigned integers efficiently
- **Error handling**: Detect and guard against inputs beyond 64-bit range
- **Code location**: `prime/nt.py` module

## Dependencies
- [ ] Python 3.11+ environment setup
- [ ] No external mathematical libraries (pure Python implementation)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L
- **Hours**: 16-20 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent of other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full type hints
- [ ] All functions handle edge cases properly
- [ ] Performance meets <1 second requirement for typical 64-bit operations
- [ ] Code passes ruff and black formatting
- [ ] Comprehensive docstrings with algorithm references
- [ ] Ready for unit testing integration
