# Task: Development Workflow and Tooling Setup

## Description
Set up the complete development workflow including dependency management, code formatting, linting, pre-commit hooks, and optional containerization. Create Makefile or task runner for common development operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Python 3.11+ environment with proper dependency management
- [ ] Ruff configuration for fast linting
- [ ] Black configuration for consistent code formatting
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks for automated code quality checks
- [ ] Makefile or task runner with common commands
- [ ] Optional Dockerfile for containerized deployment
- [ ] GitHub Actions configuration for CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Development server command: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

## Technical Details
- **Dependency management**: Requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
- **Code quality**: Ruff for linting, Black for formatting
- **Automation**: Pre-commit hooks, Makefile, GitHub Actions
- **Development experience**: Hot reload, fast feedback loops
- **Deployment**: Optional Docker containerization

## Dependencies
- [ ] Python 3.11+ environment
- [ ] Development tool dependencies (ruff, black, pre-commit)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: S
- **Hours**: 4-6 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent of other implementation tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete development environment setup
- [ ] All code quality tools configured and working
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent bad code from being committed
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs tests and quality checks
- [ ] Development workflow is smooth and efficient
- [ ] Optional Docker setup is functional
- [ ] Documentation covers setup and development process
