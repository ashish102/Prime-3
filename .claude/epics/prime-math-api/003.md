# Task: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Description
Create a comprehensive testing suite in `tests/test_prime.py` with unit tests for core mathematical functions and behavioral tests for API endpoints. Include edge case testing, performance validation, and acceptance criteria verification.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all core number theory functions with known test vectors
- [ ] Behavioral tests for all API endpoints matching acceptance criteria
- [ ] Edge case testing for boundary conditions (n=0,1,2, large numbers)
- [ ] Performance tests ensuring <1 second response times
- [ ] Error handling tests for invalid inputs
- [ ] Test coverage of at least 95% for core mathematical functions
- [ ] Pytest configuration with clear test organization

## Technical Details
- **Testing framework**: pytest with clear test organization
- **Test categories**: Unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, edge cases
- **Coverage**: Focus on 100% coverage of mathematical functions
- **Test data**: Include specific test cases from PRD acceptance criteria
- **Code location**: `tests/test_prime.py`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Core math module needed for unit testing
- [ ] Task 002: API endpoints needed for integration testing
- [ ] pytest and testing dependencies

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 10-14 hours
- **Parallel**: false (requires both core module and API)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All unit tests pass with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Behavioral tests validate PRD acceptance criteria
- [ ] Edge cases are thoroughly tested
- [ ] Performance tests confirm timeout requirements
- [ ] Test suite runs quickly with `pytest -q`
- [ ] Clear test documentation and organization
- [ ] CI-ready test configuration
